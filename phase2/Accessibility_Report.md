1. Equitable Use
Even though we didn’t provide specific gender for specific user requirements, our project is available for all users to access and enjoy their identical experience. We also have a user login system for different users to get their own email addresses and passwords.

2. Flexibility in Use
We designed two graphs for users to have a clearer look on the time they spend each day on their goals, they can choose what they prefer.  In addition, our goals can be added and deleted from the goal list, making the app flexible for study.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
The app is very easy for the users to use especially for groups of students and workers. It is similar to what they do in their agenda but in a much faster way. Also, they can review their data in the graph.

4. Perceptible Information
We made those essential elements of our GUI larger than the less essential ones. However, we could improve the perceptibility of the program by using different modes such as adding some pictorial modes or verbal modes for redundant presentation of essential information.

5. Tolerance for Error
We don’t have such features in our program. But in the future, we could make some improvements so that it would adhere to this feature. For example, we could improve the functionality of the Pormodoro Timer so that if the user enters a invalid time, the program should notify the user. And the user can  either use the default time or change the time they entered.

6. Low Physical Effort
Our program is an android app, and the size of the window is small which allows users to navigate the program easily. One way we could reduce the physical effort required further is minimizing the repetitive actions. For example, we could have more buttons on each page so that users do not need to go back to the main page each time.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program made reach to almost all components comfortable for seated and standing users. There are not any physical barriers preventing users from interacting with our program.  

- Intended Demographics:
  Our program is designed toward people who want to accomplish their goals or finish their tasks in an efficient and organized way. For instance, students, professionals, athletes etc. When we designed our program, we were considering what are the features that actually can make us, as students, work more efficiently and organized. The pomodoro timer was added since the pomodoro technique is a really useful way to work efficiently. It sets the focusing time and resting time for the user, and lets the user work in a scientific and healthy time interval cycle. The calendar part is designed to let users see things or goals they planned or need to do more directly. Finally, students, workers, professionals etc. are the people who usually need the productivity app, such as our app, to help them do things efficiently, thus our program is more targeted to these people.

- Excluded Demographics:
  There are few types of people that may not want to use our application. First of all, people with accessibility issues can’t use our program easily. The application needs users to look at the screen, then type their password and goals into the goal list. We didn’t include sound input or having any sound prompt for the user.Thus people who have issues with vision or can’t type can’t use our program. In addition, people who can’t focus for at least 25 minutes will have a suffering time using the pomodoro timer, and the pomodoro technique won’t be a good way to help them accomplish their goals.
